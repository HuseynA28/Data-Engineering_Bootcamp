## SQL Joins Explanation and Examples

Joins allow us to combine data from multiple tables based on a related column. Using the correct type of join is crucial to avoid missing data or getting incorrect results.

### 1. INNER JOIN
Returns only matching records from both tables. If a record has no match in the second table, it is excluded from the result.

#### Example: List All Orders with Product Details
```sql
SELECT 
    o.orderNumber, 
    o.orderDate, 
    od.productCode, 
    od.quantityOrdered, 
    od.priceEach
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN orderdetails od ON o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber
ORDER BY o.orderNumber;
```
ON is   used to  the the column  that both table has this called  the  . This  column  is called Foreign Keys (FK).  . YOu will also heard some thing and we will talk about the  letter Primary Keys (PK)   which mean s that help the table just correct  the uniq  value . The same columns can also Primary Keys (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK). or  one column can be Primary the other column can be FK . Just on  for teh join it is imporstn thta to have the comman column which is called  . 

YOu can also have this FK in select or not , 
 also we you see we us the alis  for the whole table , just as  customer as a c  , and order as a o . The in seletce I have to write which column from which tabe  such as c.customerNumber   . Howevert the both of them have  the the same FK coilumn  such as customerNumber if selecetion we have to write also from which table i need customerNumber  c.customerNumber or o.customerNumber.

### 2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table. If there is no match, it still returns the left table’s row but fills missing columns with NULL.

#### Example: List All Customers and Their Orders (Even If No Orders Exist)
```sql
SELECT 
    c.customerNumber, 
    c.customerName, 
    o.orderNumber, 
    o.orderDate
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber
ORDER BY c.customerNumber;
```

### 3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table. If no match exists, it still returns the right table’s row with NULL for missing columns.

#### Example: List All Orders and Their Customers (Even If Customer Info is Missing)
```sql
SELECT 
    o.orderNumber, 
    o.orderDate, 
    c.customerName, 
    c.phone
FROM orders o
RIGHT JOIN customers c ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
ORDER BY o.orderNumber;
```

### 4. FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)
Combines the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. Returns all records from both tables, filling missing data with NULL.

#### Example: Show All Orders and All Customers (Even If They Don’t Have a Match)
```sql
SELECT 
    c.customerNumber, 
    c.customerName, 
    o.orderNumber, 
    o.orderDate
FROM customers c
FULL JOIN orders o ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber
ORDER BY c.customerNumber;
```

### 5. UNION
Combines the results of two separate queries with the same structure. Removes duplicates unless UNION ALL is used.

#### Example: Get a List of All Customer and Employee Emails
```sql
SELECT email FROM customers
UNION
SELECT email FROM employees;
```

### Final Thoughts
| Join Type  | What It Does | When to Use | Risk If Used Incorrectly |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| INNER JOIN | Only matching records | When you need only related data | Can lose unmatched data |
| LEFT JOIN | All left table records + matches from right | When left-side data is important | Missing right-side data |
| RIGHT JOIN | All right table records + matches from left | When right-side data is important | Missing left-side data |
| FULL JOIN | All records from both tables | When you need all data, even unmatched | Large result sets with many NULLs |
| UNION | Merges results from two queries | When combining similar datasets | Can remove needed duplicates |
