# SQL Query Guide (PostgreSQL Version)

Welcome to the **SQL Query Guide**! This comprehensive guide will help you understand and construct SQL queries to interact with your `dvdrental` database effectively using PostgreSQL. Whether you're retrieving data, filtering results, or performing aggregations, this guide covers essential SQL concepts with clear examples.

## Selecting Data

### Select All Data
Retrieve all rows and columns from the `customer` table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dvdrental.customer;
```

- `*`: Fetches all columns.
- `dvdrental.customer`: Specifies the schema (`dvdrental`) and table (`customer`).

### Select Specific Columns
Retrieve only specific columns. For example, display the customer's full name by concatenating `first_name` and `last_name`, and include their email:

```sql
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS customer_name, email
FROM dvdrental.customer;
```

- The concatenation operator (`||`) is used in PostgreSQL.
- An alias (`customer_name`) is provided for clarity.

### Select Unique Rows
Remove duplicate values from a column to get unique entries. For instance, get unique country names from the `country` table:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM dvdrental.country;
```

- `DISTINCT`: Returns only unique values from the specified column.

---

## Aggregation Functions

### COUNT Function
Counts the number of rows or non-null values in a column.

#### Basic Syntax

```sql
-- Count all rows in the customer table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dvdrental.customer;

-- Count non-null values in a specific column (e.g., first_name)
SELECT COUNT(first_name) FROM dvdrental.customer;
```

- `COUNT(*)`: Counts all rows, including those with `NULL` values.
- `COUNT(columnName)`: Counts non-null values in the specified column.

### Count Unique Values
Count distinct values in a column, such as the number of unique store IDs in the customer table.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store_id) FROM dvdrental.customer;
```

---

## Filtering Data

### WHERE Clause
Filters rows based on specified conditions.

#### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table
WHERE condition;
```

#### Example
Get customers from store 1 or store 2:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM dvdrental.customer
WHERE store_id = 1 OR store_id = 2;
```

### Combining Conditions
Use logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) to combine multiple conditions.

#### Example
Retrieve active customers from store 1:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, activebool
FROM dvdrental.customer
WHERE store_id = 1 AND activebool = true;
```

---

## Sorting and Limiting Results

### ORDER BY Clause
Sorts results by specified column(s) in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.

#### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table
ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC];
```

#### Example
Sort customers by customer ID in descending order:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, customer_id
FROM dvdrental.customer
ORDER BY customer_id DESC;
```

### LIMIT Clause
Restricts the number of rows returned. Often paired with `ORDER BY` for "top N" queries.

#### Example
Get the top 3 customers by customer ID (assuming higher IDs indicate more recent entries):

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, customer_id
FROM dvdrental.customer
ORDER BY customer_id DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

---

## Advanced Filtering

### BETWEEN and IN Operators

#### BETWEEN Operator
Filters values within a specified range (inclusive of endpoints). For example, count rentals in May 2005:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM dvdrental.rental
WHERE rental_date BETWEEN '2005-05-01' AND '2005-05-31';
```

#### IN Operator
Checks if a value matches any value in a list. For example, get customers belonging to store 1 or store 2:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, store_id
FROM dvdrental.customer
WHERE store_id IN (1, 2);
```

## Pattern Matching with LIKE

### LIKE Operator Basics
Matches string patterns using wildcards:

| Wildcard | Description                             | Example           |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `%`      | Matches any sequence of characters      | `'A%'` → "Apple"  |
| `_`      | Matches exactly one character           | `'_at'` → "Cat"   |

#### Example
Find staff members with first names starting with "A":

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dvdrental.staff
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%';
```

### SQL Case Sensitivity with `LOWER()`, `UPPER()`, and `ILIKE`
PostgreSQL is case-sensitive by default. To perform case-insensitive pattern matching, you can either use `LOWER()` or the `ILIKE` operator:

```sql
-- Using LOWER()
SELECT *
FROM dvdrental.staff
WHERE LOWER(first_name) LIKE 'a%';

-- Using ILIKE (preferred for case-insensitive matching)
SELECT *
FROM dvdrental.staff
WHERE first_name ILIKE 'a%';
```

Both approaches will match names starting with 'A' or 'a'.

## NOT LIKE Operator
Exclude rows matching a pattern. For example, get customers whose first name does not contain "nal":

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dvdrental.customer
WHERE first_name NOT LIKE '%nal%';
```

## Common Pitfalls & Fixes

### Problem: Missing Single-Digit Dates
Incorrect approach (may not capture all date formats):

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM dvdrental.payment
WHERE payment_date::text LIKE '2004-05-__';
```

Correct approach (ensures all dates in May are captured):

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM dvdrental.payment
WHERE payment_date::text LIKE '2004-05-%';
```

*Note:* In PostgreSQL, you might need to cast date/timestamp columns to text using `::text` if you want to use the `LIKE` operator on them.

Ensure that your date patterns account for all possible formats and values.
