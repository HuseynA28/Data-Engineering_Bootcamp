# Aggregate Functions in SQL (dvdrental Version)

## Overview
SQL provides several aggregate functions to perform calculations on a set of values. Below are some commonly used aggregate functions:

- **AVG()** – Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
- **COUNT()** – Counts the number of rows in a column (excluding NULL values).
- **MAX()** – Finds the highest value in a column.
- **MIN()** – Finds the lowest value in a column.
- **SUM()** – Adds up all the values in a numeric column.
- **ROUND()** – Rounds a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places.

## Finding the Maximum and Minimum Payment Amounts

To get the highest and lowest payment amounts from the dvdrental **payment** table:

```sql
SELECT
    MAX(amount) AS max_amount,
    MIN(amount) AS min_amount
FROM payment;
```

## Finding the Payment Date of the Maximum Amount

If you try to find the date of the highest payment using:

```sql
SELECT
    MAX(amount),
    payment_date
FROM payment;
```

you will get an error because `MAX(amount)` returns only one value while `payment_date` may have multiple corresponding values. To fix this, you need to use **GROUP BY**.

## Using Multiple Aggregate Functions Together

You can combine different aggregate functions in one query. For example:

```sql
SELECT
    MAX(amount) AS max_amount,
    MIN(amount) AS min_amount,
    AVG(amount) AS avg_amount
FROM payment;
```

## Rounding the Average Value

The `AVG()` function often returns a number with many decimal places. To make it easier to read, you can round the result using `ROUND()`:

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(amount), 2) AS rounded_avg
FROM payment;
```

This rounds the average amount to 2 decimal places.

## Calculating the Total Amount of Payments

```sql
SELECT
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM payment;
```

## Using GROUP BY

The `GROUP BY` statement allows you to group rows based on a specific column and perform calculations on each group separately.

For example, if you need to find the total payment amount for each day:

```sql
SELECT
    DATE(payment_date) AS payment_day,
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM payment
WHERE payment_date BETWEEN '2004-01-01' AND '2004-12-31'
GROUP BY DATE(payment_date)
ORDER BY DATE(payment_date);
```

### How the Query Works

1. **FROM (`payment` table):** The query selects data from the dvdrental **payment** table.
2. **WHERE:** Filters the data before aggregation (here, selecting payments from 2004).
3. **GROUP BY:** Groups the filtered data by the date portion of `payment_date`.
4. **SELECT:** Calculates the total payment for each day.
5. **ORDER BY:** Sorts the results by the payment day.

> **Important SQL Rules:**
> - Every column in the `SELECT` statement must either be part of an aggregate function or included in the `GROUP BY` clause.
> - The `WHERE` clause cannot refer to the result of an aggregation because filtering occurs before aggregation. Use the `HAVING` clause for filtering on aggregated results.

## Using Aggregation Functions with ORDER BY

You can sort results based on aggregated values. For example, to see the total payment amount processed by each staff member:

```sql
SELECT
    staff_id,
    SUM(amount) AS total_payment
FROM payment
GROUP BY staff_id
ORDER BY total_payment DESC;
```

Using an alias (here, `total_payment`) improves readability—but note that you cannot use the alias in the `WHERE` clause.

## Ordering by Multiple Columns

You can order by more than one column; the order of these columns matters. For example, consider analyzing film data by grouping films by their rating. In the dvdrental **film** table, you can write:

```sql
SELECT
    rating,
    COUNT(*) AS film_count,
    AVG(rental_rate) AS avg_rental_rate
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY avg_rental_rate ASC, film_count DESC;
```

This query groups films by their **rating**, counts the number of films in each rating category, and calculates the average rental rate. The results are then sorted first by the average rental rate (ascending) and then by the film count (descending).

## Extracting Date Information for Aggregation

If a date column includes time information, you can use the `DATE()` function to extract only the year, month, and day. This is useful when grouping by date:

```sql
SELECT
    DATE(payment_date) AS payment_day,
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM payment
GROUP BY DATE(payment_date);
```

## Using HAVING for Filtering Aggregated Results

The `WHERE` clause filters raw data before aggregation, but to filter aggregated results you use the `HAVING` clause. For example:

```sql
SELECT
    DATE(payment_date) AS payment_day,
    SUM(amount) AS sum_amount
FROM payment
WHERE payment_date BETWEEN '2005-01-01' AND '2006-01-01'
GROUP BY DATE(payment_date)
HAVING SUM(amount) > 5000;
```

This query filters for days where the total payment amount exceeds 5000.

## Execution Order of SQL Statements

SQL queries do not execute in the written order. Instead, they follow a logical processing order. Consider the following query:

```sql
SELECT
    DATE(payment_date) AS payment_day,
    SUM(amount) AS sum_amount
FROM payment
WHERE payment_date BETWEEN '2005-01-01' AND '2006-01-01'
GROUP BY DATE(payment_date)
HAVING SUM(amount) > 5000
ORDER BY sum_amount DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Execution Order:
1. **FROM:** Identifies the source table (`payment`).
2. **WHERE:** Filters rows (payments between 2005 and 2006).
3. **GROUP BY:** Groups the remaining rows by the date part of `payment_date`.
4. **SELECT:** Calculates aggregates such as `SUM(amount)`.
5. **HAVING:** Filters groups based on aggregated values.
6. **ORDER BY:** Sorts the groups by the total amount in descending order.
7. **LIMIT:** Returns only the top 10 results.

### Why This Order?
- **FROM first:** SQL determines the data source.
- **WHERE before GROUP BY:** Filtering reduces the data size for aggregation.
- **GROUP BY before HAVING:** Aggregation must occur before filtering on aggregates.
- **SELECT after GROUP BY:** Aggregated values are computed after grouping.
- **HAVING after SELECT:** Filters based on aggregate calculations.
- **ORDER BY after HAVING:** Sorts the final filtered results.
- **LIMIT last:** Restricts the number of returned rows after sorting.
