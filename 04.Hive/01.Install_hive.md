# Apache Hive Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install and start Apache Hive on a system where Hadoop is installed in `~/02.Hadoop/hadoop` and Hive will be installed in a separate directory (e.g., `~/04.Hive/hive`). In this guide, we will use the default settings (including the default embedded Derby metastore) without customizing the Hive configuration file (`hive-site.xml`).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Hadoop Installation:** Ensure Hadoop is installed in `~/02.Hadoop/hadoop`.
- **Java Installation:** Make sure Java is installed and `JAVA_HOME` is set (e.g., `/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0`).

---

## 1. Create the Hive Directory

Open your terminal and run the following commands to create a new directory for Hive and download the Hive binary:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p ~/04.Hive
cd ~/04.Hive

# Download Hive (version 4.0.1 used as an example)
wget https://downloads.apache.org/hive/hive-4.0.1/apache-hive-4.0.1-bin.tar.gz

# Extract the downloaded archive
tar -xzvf apache-hive-4.0.1-bin.tar.gz

# Rename the extracted folder for convenience
mv apache-hive-4.0.1-bin hive
```

Your Hive installation is now located at `~/04.Hive/hive`.

---

## 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Update your shell environment variables so that Hive and Hadoop are both recognized. Open your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.profile`) in a text editor:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add or update the following lines (adjust paths if necessary):

```bash
# Hadoop environment variables (already set for your Hadoop installation)
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0
export HADOOP_HOME=~/02.Hadoop/hadoop
export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=$HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop
export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$HADOOP_HOME/sbin

# Hive environment variables (Hive installed in 04.Hive)
export HIVE_HOME=~/04.Hive/hive
export PATH=$PATH:$HIVE_HOME/bin
```

Save and exit the editor (in Nano: press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

Reload the environment variables with:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

## 3. Initialize the Hive Metastore

Initialize the embedded Derby metastore. This step creates the necessary schema for Hive to store metadata:

```bash
schematool -dbType derby -initSchema
```

If the metastore schema is successfully initialized, you will see confirmation output in your terminal.

---

## 4. Start the Hive Shell

Now youâ€™re ready to start Hive. Launch the Hive command-line interface by running:

```bash
hive
```

If successful, you will see a Hive prompt similar to:

```shell
hive>
```

At this point, Hive is ready to accept queries and will interact with your Hadoop cluster located in `~/02.Hadoop/hadoop`.

---

## Summary

- **Hive Installation Directory:** `~/04.Hive/hive`
- **Hadoop Installation Directory:** `~/02.Hadoop/hadoop`
- **Metastore:** Default embedded Derby metastore (initialized via `schematool`)
- **Environment Variables:** Ensure `JAVA_HOME`, `HADOOP_HOME`, and `HIVE_HOME` are set correctly

Enjoy using Hive with your Hadoop setup!
