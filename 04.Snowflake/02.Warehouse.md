The keys to using warehouses effectively and efficiently are:

Experiment with different types of queries and different warehouse sizes to determine the combinations that best meet your specific query needs and workload.

Don’t focus on warehouse size. Snowflake utilizes per-second billing, so you can run larger warehouses (Large, X-Large, 2X-Large, etc.) and simply suspend them when not in use.

Credit charges are calculated based on:

The warehouse size.

The number of clusters (if using multi-cluster warehouses).

The length of time the compute resources in each cluster runs.


The Enterprise  editdition cost 3 dollar 60 minutes per  which is 5 c per minute .

if you have Small 2 credics/ hour  then . you have to pay 2 x 5 = 10 cen per minute for nodes . But if you have  Multi cluster warehouse   let us say that you have max and min 2 clauster  then you will pay 2 *2 *5 = 20 cent per minute 
and we have  Scaling Policy   which is 

Startdart (explain each of them )
Economy  (explain each of them )

If  you the time is less than 1 minute it will cost 1 minute , however it it mre than 1 minute then  the cost will be second base . Eben  chnaging the whare house will be cost something . It takes less than one minute but it will be calated as one minute 

If you trasnfer the data from Snpowlfake to local will will cost some monat  and clous pricever  (Aws , Azure and CSp ) charge this  amount . 


If a warehouse runs for 30 to 60 seconds, it is billed for 60 seconds.

If a warehouse runs for 61 seconds, it is billed for only 61 seconds.

If a warehouse runs for 61 seconds, shuts down, and then restarts and runs for less than 60 seconds, it is billed for 121 seconds (60 + 1 + 60).

Resizing between a 5XL or 6XL warehouse to a 4XL or smaller warehouse results in a brief period during which the customer is charged for both the new warehouse and the old warehouse while the old warehouse is quiesced.


"The overall size of the tables being queried has more impact than the number of rows" means that when a data warehouse processes a query, the total amount of data (measured in storage size like GB or TB) affects performance more than just the number of rows in the table.

 In Snowflake (and other databases), joins are often necessary to combine data from different tables. However, you should:

Filter Early: Use the WHERE clause to filter data as early as possible. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed, especially before performing joins.
Minimize Unnecessary Joins: Only join tables that are required for your query. Extra joins can add overhead, so it's best to design your queries efficiently.
In short, it's about smart query design: use filtering (WHERE clauses) to limit data before joining, rather than simply avoiding joins.


To achieve the best results, try to execute relatively homogeneous queries (complexity, data sets, etc.) on the same warehouse; executing queries of widely varying complexity on the same warehouse makes it more difficult to analyze warehouse load, which can make it more difficult to select the best warehouse size to match the complexity, composition, and number of queries in your workload.

Each warehouse, when running, maintains a cache of table data accessed as queries are processed by the warehouse. This enables improved performance for subsequent queries if they are able to read from the cache instead of from the table(s) in the query


For queries in small-scale testing environments, smaller warehouses sizes (X-Small, Small, Medium) may be sufficient.

For queries in large-scale production environments, larger warehouse sizes (Large, X-Large, 2X-Large, etc.) may be more cost effective.


Certain Snowsight pages, such as Task Run History or Data Preview, require a warehouse to run SQL queries in order to display more than just metadata. On these pages, a warehouse selector indicates the warehouse where these UI queries are running. A green dot indicates when the warehouse is active.

An X-Small warehouse is recommended and generally sufficient for most of these queries, however large accounts may see performance improvements by using a larger warehouse.

Snowflake supports resizing a warehouse at any time, even while running. If a query is running slowly and you have additional queries of similar size and complexity that you want to run on the same warehouse, you might choose to resize the warehouse while it is running; however, note the following:

As stated earlier about warehouse size, larger is not necessarily faster; for smaller, basic queries that are already executing quickly, you may not see any significant improvement after resizing.

Resizing a running warehouse does not impact queries that are already being processed by the warehouse; the additional compute resources, once fully provisioned, are only used for queued and new queries.

Resizing between a 5XL or 6XL warehouse to a 4XL or smaller warehouse results in a brief period during which the customer is charged for both the new warehouse and the old warehouse while the old warehouse is quiesced.

Decreasing the size of a running warehouse removes compute resources from the warehouse. When the computer resources are removed, the cache associated with those resources is dropped, which can impact performance in the same way that suspending the warehouse can impact performance after it is resumed.

Keep this in mind when choosing whether to decrease the size of a running warehouse or keep it at the current size. In other words, there is a trade-off with regards to saving credits versus maintaining the cache.


ncreasing Warehouse Size:
When you increase the size of a warehouse, you’re adding more compute clusters to the existing setup.
The existing compute clusters (and their cache) remain untouched, and the new clusters start fresh but work alongside the old ones.
This means you retain the cache from the resources that were already running, so query performance doesn’t drop due to cache loss.
2. Decreasing Warehouse Size:
When you decrease the size, you’re removing compute clusters from the warehouse.
The cache stored on the removed clusters is lost, which can slow down performance for queries that relied on that cached data.
It’s like shutting down parts of a machine—anything stored in those parts disappears.

Resizing a Warehouse:
When you resize a warehouse (for example, from SMALL to MEDIUM), you're instructing Snowflake to allocate more (or fewer) virtual compute resources to that warehouse.

Increasing the Size: The existing compute resources (and their cache) remain active. Additional resources are added to boost capacity without disturbing what’s already running.
Decreasing the Size: Some of the virtual compute resources are deallocated. When these resources are removed, the cache associated with them is also lost, which can affect performance until the cache is rebuilt.
