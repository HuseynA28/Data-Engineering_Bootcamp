If you have not crerate the stage you can create new one, let us call it 
myjsonformat

  CREATE STAGE IF NOT EXISTS mystage;


Load the datasets/json_files/json_files  to the snowflake 
make sure  that you have dowlaod the file 
   list @mystage;


create or replace file format  myjsonformat
type= json;

CREATE STAGE IF NOT EXISTS mystage;

list @mystage;

drop stage mystage ;

select  *from table (infer_schema(
location=>'@mystage',
files=>'mycars.json',
file_format=>'myjsonformat'));



You will see the data in the we have  just one data: strcuted  there fore we see just one data points 

After  that you can   create a table for  that , but as we do not know how how our data look like ,  we can create a table with one column and the type of this column will be variant


create temporary table temp_my_cars(v variant);

after  that we can load now the  data to table 

copy into temp_my_cars from @mystage
files=('mycars.json')
file_format=(format_name=myjsonformat)
force=true


Now we can select  the all of the data to look at 

select * from temp_my_cars;

But ofcourse  we want to see the data in table format tabular format 
we need  to flatten the data . We can use lateral flatten() method for  that 

select * 
from temp_my_cars, 
lateral flatten(input=>temp_my_cars.v, path=>'data') d;

input there show  the name of  the column.  the data path show the falte opject itself. and Flatten return  some columns name as as value and this . For as
teh value is interested , as  you see it return the value of data   



select * 
from temp_my_cars, 
lateral flatten(input=>temp_my_cars.v, path=>'data') d;  

select d.value
from temp_my_cars, 
lateral flatten(input=>temp_my_cars.v, path=>'data') d;
it will return all o=f  the columns and  value but as a key : value format , but we can covert it to correct format with 

select 
d.value:am, 
d.value:carb, 
d.value:cyl,
d.value:disp,
d.value:drat,
d.value:gear,
d.value:hp,
d.value:model,
d.value:mpg,
d.value:qsec,
d.value:vs,
d.value:wt
from temp_my_cars, 
lateral flatten(input=>temp_my_cars.v, path=>'data') d;

of course  you can change the column namd and also the data type 


SELECT 
    IFF(d.value:am = 1, TRUE, FALSE) AS am, 
    d.value:carb::NUMBER(1) AS carb, 
    d.value:cyl::NUMBER AS cyl, 
    d.value:disp::NUMBER AS disp, 
    d.value:drat::NUMBER AS drat, 
    d.value:gear::NUMBER AS gear, 
    d.value:hp::NUMBER AS hp, 
    d.value:model::VARCHAR(20) AS model, 
    d.value:mpg::NUMBER AS mpg, 
    d.value:qsec::NUMBER AS qsec, 
    d.value:vs::NUMBER AS vs, 
    d.value:wt::NUMBER AS wt
FROM temp_my_cars, 
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => temp_my_cars.v, path => 'data') d;
 

## LAteral just help us to join   so that we can use use also  table , 

SELECT 
    IFF(d.value:am = 1, TRUE, FALSE) AS am, 
    d.value:carb::NUMBER(1) AS carb, 
    d.value:cyl::NUMBER AS cyl, 
    d.value:disp::NUMBER AS disp, 
    d.value:drat::NUMBER AS drat, 
    d.value:gear::NUMBER AS gear, 
    d.value:hp::NUMBER AS hp, 
    d.value:model::VARCHAR(20) AS model, 
    d.value:mpg::NUMBER AS mpg, 
    d.value:qsec::NUMBER AS qsec, 
    d.value:vs::NUMBER AS vs, 
    d.value:wt::NUMBER AS wt
FROM temp_my_cars, 
table ( FLATTEN(input => temp_my_cars.v, path => 'data')) d; 

it doe smena that first the flanne the a table  afte r hat from this table we get a values and  create a new  table , So in this operation we have to tables


Onay now th e time is to create  a  table  we can use   create transaiert tabe mycars as 

CREATE TRANSIENT  TABLE mytemptable  as 

SELECT 
    IFF(d.value:am = 1, TRUE, FALSE) AS am, 
    d.value:carb::NUMBER(1) AS carb, 
    d.value:cyl::NUMBER AS cyl, 
    d.value:disp::NUMBER AS disp, 
    d.value:drat::NUMBER AS drat, 
    d.value:gear::NUMBER AS gear, 
    d.value:hp::NUMBER AS hp, 
    d.value:model::VARCHAR(20) AS model, 
    d.value:mpg::NUMBER AS mpg, 
    d.value:qsec::NUMBER AS qsec, 
    d.value:vs::NUMBER AS vs, 
    d.value:wt::NUMBER AS wt
FROM temp_my_cars, 
table ( FLATTEN(input => temp_my_cars.v, path => 'data')) d;

##  Create some sample  dataste 

SELECT 'Car', PARSE_JSON($$ {'features':[
  {'type':'Engine', 'specs':['V8', 'Turbo']},
  {'type':'Safety', 'specs':['ABS', 'Airbags']}
]} $$)
UNION  
SELECT 'Bike', PARSE_JSON($$ {'features':[
  {'type':'Engine', 'specs':['Single Cylinder', 'Fuel Injection']},
  {'type':'Brakes', 'specs':['Disc', 'ABS']}
]} $$);
## Let us save this infor as a temport table 
create temporary table cars(name string , v variant) as 
SELECT 'Car', PARSE_JSON($$ {'features':[
  {'type':'Engine', 'specs':['V8', 'Turbo']},
  {'type':'Safety', 'specs':['ABS', 'Airbags']}
]} $$)
UNION  
SELECT 'Bike', PARSE_JSON($$ {'features':[
  {'type':'Engine', 'specs':['Single Cylinder', 'Fuel Injection']},
  {'type':'Brakes', 'specs':['Disc', 'ABS']}
]} $$);


after  that we  can fllaten the data 

SELECT 
    c.name, 
    d.value:type AS feature_type,
   specs.value AS spec
FROM cars c, 
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => c.V, path => 'features') d,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => d.value:specs) specs

As you see  that as you have arry you can flatten  this array also , to get the table with all of  the  
Again we can also  use table insead of  the table 
SELECT 
    c.name, 
    d.value:type AS feature_type,
   specs.value AS spec
FROM cars c, 
table( FLATTEN(input => c.V, path => 'features')) d,
table( FLATTEN(input => d.value:specs)) specs;


we have also the outer=> true  which help use  to fatten oulos the  orthen  values 

what is   result_scan( ) in snowflake explain it
