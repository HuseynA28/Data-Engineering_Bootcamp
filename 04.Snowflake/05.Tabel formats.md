CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE TRANSACTIONS (
    Transaction_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    Transaction_Date TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO TRANSACTIONS (Transaction_ID, Amount, Transaction_Date) VALUES
(1, 100.50, '2024-03-20 10:15:00'),

    Sale_Amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    Sale_Date DATE
);

INSERT INTO SALES (Sale_ID, Product_Name, Quantity_Sold, Sale_Amount, Sale_Date) VALUES
