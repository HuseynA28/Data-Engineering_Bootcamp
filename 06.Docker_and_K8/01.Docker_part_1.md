There are different why to get the docker image  and create a container from this image. 
1. Uplaod the image form the docker hub ,  such as Python or other well know progmart lanaguage or tool . Let us install python imgage and use it 

go to https://hub.docker.com/  and seach for python  and copy 

docker pull python  it will get teh latst version , if you want old verson you can use other versions . The open the Terminal  shell  and past  the code and press enter . Now you have a new version of python image . But the conatiner is not created for the python image . You can create the container from teh image . If you want to look at the docker images to make use that you dowload eit  

docker images 

you will see the python name and Tag as latets version or the version you chose to pull.

you can  create a docker by runining   
docker run --name mypython -it python:latest bash
However if you just create a image then run it letter 
docker run --name mypython -d python:latest

After  this code our docker will create and will automatcis stap  . To look at all of the stoped  docker ps -a

then you start the docker my giving its name or cotaine id 

docker start mypython

you can usee  the docker -ps   to look at the runnign docer 

now our python docker is running if you wnat to login in ppython and write some code  then 

docker exec -it mypython bash

you can write you python code .   type exit to exit 

if you run the  exectute the a python script in the conatiner 

docker exec mypython python3 /script.py


YOucan start all of the conatienr with 
docker start -a 

The things is that the pyton in our local and in cconter are different. 

if you wnat to staop  teh docker    

docker stop mypython

then if you want to stopp all of the running  docker then use the 
docker stop -a 

we can start many container we want based on our the image 


docker run -name mypython2 -d  python:latest
