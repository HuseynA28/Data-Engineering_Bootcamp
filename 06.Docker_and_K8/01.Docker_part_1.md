# How to Get a Docker Image and Create a Container

## 1. Download a Docker Image from Docker Hub
Docker provides pre-built images for various programming languages and tools, including Python. To download a Python image, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Search for the Python Image
Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and search for `python`. You will find different versions of Python images.

### Step 2: Pull the Python Image
To get the latest version of Python, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
docker pull python
```
If you want a specific version, specify the version tag, for example:
```sh
docker pull python:3.9
```

### Step 3: Verify the Downloaded Image
After pulling the image, check whether it is available on your system by running:
```sh
docker images
```
This command will display the downloaded images along with their versions (tags).

---
## 2. Create a Container from the Image
After downloading the image, you need to create and run a container from it.

### Option 1: Run a Container Interactively
To create and start a container interactively with a bash shell, use:
```sh
docker run --name mypython -it python:latest bash
```
- `--name mypython`: Names the container "mypython" for easy reference.
- `-it`: Runs the container interactively.
- `python:latest`: Uses the latest Python image.
- `bash`: Opens a shell inside the container.

### Option 2: Run a Container in the Background
If you want to create the container but run it in detached mode (background), use:
```sh
docker run --name mypython -d python:latest
```
- `-d`: Runs the container in the background.

### Step 4: View Running and Stopped Containers
To check all containers (including stopped ones), run:
```sh
docker ps -a
```
To see only running containers:
```sh
docker ps
```

---
## 3. Start, Stop, and Manage Containers

### Start a Stopped Container
To restart a container that was previously stopped, use:
```sh
docker start mypython
```
Or, if you prefer to use the container ID instead of the name:
```sh
docker start <container_id>
```

### Stop a Running Container
To stop a specific container, use:
```sh
docker stop mypython
```
To stop all running containers at once:
```sh
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

### Restart All Stopped Containers
To restart all stopped containers:
```sh
docker start $(docker ps -aq)
```

---
## 4. Execute Commands Inside a Running Container

### Open a Bash Shell Inside the Container
To enter the container and interact with it:
```sh
docker exec -it mypython bash
```
- This allows you to use the container just like a normal Linux environment.

### Run a Python Script Inside the Container
If you have a Python script inside the container, you can execute it using:
```sh
docker exec mypython python3 /script.py
```

---
## 5. Running Multiple Containers from the Same Image
You can start multiple containers using the same image by assigning different names:
```sh
docker run --name mypython2 -d python:latest
```
This creates another container named `mypython2` based on the Python image.

---
### Important Notes:
- **Python in the container is separate from your local Python installation.** Any packages installed inside the container will not affect your local Python environment.
- **Containers are isolated environments.** If you need to persist data, you should use Docker volumes or bind mounts.
- **You can remove a container if you no longer need it.** Use:
  ```sh
  docker rm mypython
  ```
- **To remove an image from your system:**
  ```sh
  docker rmi python
  ```
  This removes the image, but only if no containers are using it.

This guide should help students understand Docker basics while keeping the necessary commands intact and correctly explained.
