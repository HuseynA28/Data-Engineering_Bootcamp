# Creating Your Own Docker Image

## 1. Introduction
Instead of using a pre-built image from Docker Hub, you can create your own custom Docker image. This is useful when you need a specific environment with customized configurations.

---
## 2. Setting Up Your Docker Image
To create a Docker image, you need a special file named **Dockerfile**. This file contains instructions on how Docker should build the image.

### Step 1: Create a Dockerfile
In your project folder, create a new file named **Dockerfile** (without any extension).

### Step 2: Define the Base Image
A Docker image is built on top of an existing image. The `FROM` command specifies which image to use as a base.

For example, if you want a Python environment, add this line to your Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM python:latest
```
This will use the latest Python image as the base. If you have already downloaded this image (from Part 1), Docker will use the local copy instead of pulling it from the internet.

### Step 3: Copy Files to the Container
Use the `COPY` command to transfer files from your local computer to the Docker container.
- To copy everything from the current directory to the container’s root directory:
  ```dockerfile
  COPY . .
  ```
- To copy files to a specific folder inside the container:
  ```dockerfile
  COPY . /myfolder
  ```
- To copy a single file:
  ```dockerfile
  COPY script.py /myfolder
  ```
This will copy `script.py` from your local folder to `/myfolder` inside the container.

### Step 4: Install Required Libraries
Use the `RUN` command to install dependencies. For example, to install `pandas`:
```dockerfile
RUN pip install pandas
```
However, if you copied your script into a subfolder (like `/myfolder`), running this command will install the library in the root directory while your script is in `/myfolder`. To avoid issues, tell Docker to work inside `/myfolder` by using:
```dockerfile
WORKDIR /myfolder
```
This sets the working directory to `/myfolder`, ensuring that all subsequent commands execute inside this directory.

### Step 5: Run Your Application
Use the `CMD` command to specify how your application should start when the container runs.
For example, if you're running a FastAPI application, your **Dockerfile** might look like this: (Here you can find the Docker files: https://github.com/HuseynA28/Data-Engineering_Bootcamp/blob/main/06.Docker_and_K8/Dockerfolder)
```dockerfile
FROM python:latest
WORKDIR /myapp_folder
COPY requirements.txt myapp.py  /myapp_folder/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8060
CMD ["uvicorn", "myapp:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8060", "--reload"]
```

### Explanation of Each Command:
- `FROM python:latest` → Uses the latest Python environment.
- `WORKDIR /myapp_folder` → Creates and sets `/myapp_folder` as the working directory.
- `COPY requirements.txt myapp.py /myapp_folder/` → Copies the necessary files to the container.
- `RUN pip install -r requirements.txt` → Installs required libraries from `requirements.txt`.
- `EXPOSE 8060` → Informs Docker that this application will use port 8060.
- `CMD [...]` → Runs FastAPI when the container starts.

---
## 3. Building and Running the Docker Image

### Step 1: Build the Docker Image
Run the following command in the terminal (inside the folder where the Dockerfile is located):
```sh
docker build -t fastapi-docker .
```
- `docker build` → Builds the Docker image.
- `-t fastapi-docker` → Tags the image with the name `fastapi-docker`.
- `.` → Tells Docker to use the current directory.

The thing is that it will run, but in Docker, you cannot access it with the port from outside the world to your Docker container.

### Step 2: Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, run the container using:
```sh
docker run -d --name myapp -p 8060:8060 fastapi-docker
```
Explanation of the parameters:
- `docker run` → Runs a new container.
- `-d` → Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `--name myapp` → Names the container `myapp`.
- `-p 8060:8060` → Maps port 8060 of the container to port 8060 of your machine. (First 8060 shows the port in your localhost, second 8060 shows the port in Docker)
- `fastapi-docker` → Specifies the image to use.

### Step 3: Access the Application
After running the container, open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8060/docs
```
This will display the FastAPI interface.

---
## 4. Summary
- **A Dockerfile** is needed to build a custom Docker image.
- **Base images** provide an environment to build on (`FROM python:latest`).
- **Files and dependencies** need to be copied and installed inside the container (`COPY`, `RUN`).
- **The working directory** should be set correctly (`WORKDIR`).
- **The application must be started using `CMD`**.
- **Use `docker build` to create the image and `docker run` to start a container.**

By following these steps, you can create your own Docker images and run custom applications in isolated environments!
