# Dockerfile Example and Image Layers

## Consider the following Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM python:latest
WORKDIR /myapp_folder
COPY requirements.txt myapp.py /myapp_folder/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8060
CMD ["uvicorn", "myapp:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8060", "--reload"]
```

## What Are Image Layers?

### Each Instruction Is a Layer:
Every command (e.g., `FROM`, `WORKDIR`, `COPY`, `RUN`, etc.) in a Dockerfile creates a separate image layer. These layers are stacked on top of one another to form the final Docker image.

**Key point:** Once built, each layer is immutable (read-only). If you need to change any part of your image, you must rebuild that layer.

**Reference:** [Docker documentation on image layers](https://docs.docker.com/)

### Immutability and Reuse:
Because layers are unchangeable, Docker can reuse layers from previous builds if the instructions and their context (e.g., files copied or commands run) have not changed. This means that if you rebuild your image without modifying earlier steps, Docker uses a cached version of those layers—resulting in a very fast build.

## How Docker Build Caching Works

### Caching Mechanism:
When you run a build, Docker compares each step against its cache. If nothing has changed in a given step, Docker reuses the previously built layer rather than rebuilding it. For example, if you have not modified `requirements.txt` or `myapp.py`, the `COPY` command’s layer and the following `RUN` command’s layer will be reused.

### Cache Invalidation:
If you change one instruction (or any file used by that instruction), Docker invalidates that layer and all subsequent layers. This means even a small change in an early step causes Docker to rebuild all later steps.

**Practical Tip:** Arrange your Dockerfile so that steps that change less frequently (e.g., installing dependencies) come before those that change more often (e.g., copying your application code). This maximizes cache reuse and speeds up builds.

**Reference:** [Docker documentation on using the build cache](https://docs.docker.com/)

## Helpful Docker CLI Commands

When troubleshooting or managing your Docker images and containers, you can use various commands along with the `--help` flag to see available options:

### General Help:
Use the `--help` flag with any Docker command to display its usage information. For example:

```bash
docker ps --help
```
This will show you all options available with `docker ps`.

### Other Useful Commands:

- `-t`: Used with `docker build` to tag your image (e.g., `docker build -t myapp .`).
- `docker image inspect`: Provides detailed information about a Docker image.
- `docker rmi`: Removes one or more Docker images.
- `docker prune`: Cleans up unused Docker objects (containers, images, volumes, etc.).
- `docker ps` and `docker ps -a`: Lists running containers and all containers (including stopped ones), respectively.
- `docker logs <container>`: Displays the logs of a running (or stopped) container.

## Difference Between `docker run` and `docker start`

Understanding the distinction between these two commands is crucial:

### `docker run`:

**What it does:**
- Creates a new container from a specified image and immediately starts it.

**Use Case:**
- When you want to launch a container for the first time. It combines both container creation and startup.

**Example:**
```bash
docker run -d --name mycontainer python:latest
```


### `docker start`:

**What it does:**
- Starts an existing container that has been previously created (and is currently stopped).

**Use Case:**
- When you have already created a container (for example, using `docker create` or after stopping a container with `docker stop`) and now want to resume its operation.

**Example:**
```bash
docker start mycontainer
```


## . Attached vs. Detached Mode

### Attached Mode (docker run without -d):
- Runs the container in the foreground.
- You see the container's output directly in your terminal.
- Your terminal is blocked until the container stops.

### Detached Mode (docker run -d):
- Runs the container in the background.
- Returns control of the terminal immediately.
- Use `docker logs <container>` to view output.

## . Understanding -i, -t, and -a

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-i` | Keep STDIN open (allows input to the container) |
| `-t` | Allocate a pseudo-TTY (provides terminal formatting) |
| `-a` | Attach to STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR (used with `docker start`/`docker attach`) |

### Common Combinations:

#### `-it`: Used with `docker run` for interactive containers (e.g., shells)
```bash
docker run -it python:latest /bin/bash
```

#### `-ai`: Used with `docker start` to attach to and interact with a restarted container
```bash
docker start -ai mycontainer
```

## . Container Cleanup Commands

### Delete Specific Containers:
#### Stop the containers:
```bash
docker stop container1 container2
```

#### Remove the containers:
```bash
docker rm container1 container2
```

### Delete All Containers:
#### Stop all running containers:
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

#### Remove all containers:
```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

### Auto-Remove Containers:
```bash
docker run --rm -d --name temp-container my-image
```

## 5. Image Cleanup Commands

### Delete Specific Image:
```bash
docker rmi image-name:tag
```

### Remove Dangling Images:
```bash
docker image prune
```

### Remove All Unused Images:
```bash
docker image prune -a
```

## 6. Key Differences: `docker run` vs `docker start`

| Command         | `docker run`                            | `docker start`                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Action        | Creates and starts a new container   | Restarts an existing stopped container |
| Flags         | Uses `-it` for interactive sessions  | Uses `-a` to attach to output |
| Image Required | Yes (requires an image name)       | No (uses an existing container ID/name) |
| Use Case       | New container instance             | Resume previous container state |

## 7. Practical Examples

### Interactive Python Container:
```bash
docker run -it --name py-container python:latest
```

### Start Stopped Container:
```bash
docker start -a py-container  # Attach to output
```

### Run Detached Web Server:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8060:8060 --name web-server my-web-app
```

## 8. Pro Tips

### Layer Ordering:
Place `COPY` instructions for dependency files (like `requirements.txt`) before copying the application code to maximize cache efficiency.

### Debugging Containers:
Use `docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash` to inspect running containers.

### Persistent Data:
Use volumes (`-v`) for databases or user-generated content.

### Resource Limits:
Use `--memory` and `--cpus` flags to restrict container resources.


### Summary:

- Use `docker run` to **create and run** a new container.
- Use `docker start` to **resume** a container that has been stopped.

## . Sharing Docker Images

### Step 1: Create a Repository on Docker Hub
1. Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
2. Sign in to your account or create one.
3. Click on "Create Repository."
4. Choose a name and set visibility (public or private).

### Step 2: Tag the Image
- Instead of deleting an existing image, you can tag it with a new name:
```bash
docker tag my-image:latest my-dockerhub-username/my-repo:latest
```
- In this case, you do not get rid of the old image; instead, you clone it with the new name.
- You can also push the Docker image with a specific tag.

### Step 3: Log in to Docker Hub from the Terminal
```bash
docker login
```

### Step 4: Push the Image to Docker Hub
```bash
docker push my-dockerhub-username/my-repo:latest
```

##  Copying Files Into and Out of a Running Container

### Copy a File into a Running Container
1. Start the container:
```bash
docker run -d --name myapp my-image
```
2. Copy a file or directory:
```bash
docker cp Dockerfolder/. myapp:/Dockerfolder_test
```
   - Successfully copied 5.63kB to `myapp:/Dockerfolder_test`.

### Copy a File from a Running Container
1. Access the container shell:
```bash
docker exec -it myapp bash
```
2. Create the destination folder (if needed):
```bash
mkdir test_copy_folder
```
   - If you do not create the folder first, Docker will give an error.
3. Copy the file:
```bash
docker cp copy_test.txt myapp:/test_copy_folder/copy_test.txt
```

### Naming Containers
By default, Docker assigns automatic names to containers. You can use the `--name` flag to name it as you would like:
```bash
docker run --name custom-name my-image
```
