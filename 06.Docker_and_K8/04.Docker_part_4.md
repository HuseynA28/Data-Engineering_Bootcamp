Volumns 
Volumns are folders on your local host machine hard drive which are mounted  into containers.
(explain better the volumns) 

this we can add the volumn to docker images 

```dockerfile
FROM python:latest
WORKDIR /myapp_folder
COPY requirements.txt myapp.py /myapp_folder/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8060
VOLUME ["/myapp_folder/volumns_folder"]
CMD ["uvicorn", "myapp:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8060", "--reload"]
```
Let us build the docekr   docker build -t myapp:volume .
 let us creat the conatiner based on the image 
docker run -d  -p 8070:8060 --rm --name myappwithvolume myapp:volume

It means  that  if the docker crate a file insisde teh conatiner it will save it in  this volumn 

There are two kind of the volumns
Anonymous volumns   and Named volumnes 

If you wnat to look at the values  you can type docker volume ls 

then it will print  the all of the vauls , if you see the weaird namsing  for  the vaolumns it such as a log number  it means  that this vaolume is Ananomois and there are keep in 
/myapp_folder/volumns_folder  which are alsom mouted to you local computer  and there are sepereted form teh conationer . However is teh conatiner is deleted the annomis values also will be deleted (explain the reason behand it ) > the anonomus  vaolus are not helpfull if we wan to keep  the data after the conatiners are deleted 

Named volumns

The volumns are not deleted  . in the  named volumn  we do not need not add   VOLUME  paramete rto image , we have to deleted it 


INdeased of write VOLUMNE in image script  we need  -v parametr  while creating a conatiner from the image 

docker run -d -p 8060:8060 --name myapp --rm -v volumn_file:/myapp_folder/volumns_folder app:volume

in this case after stop the conatiner it will not deleted 

Also we  have 

Bind Mounts (explain it better)

YOu define a folder   path on your host mahcine . It definewhen you run the docke r

The docekr should have right to writ this folder 

docker run -v "C:\Users\habdullayev\Documents\others\GitHub\My Projects\Data-Engineering_Bootcamp:/app" app:volume

but  you need to run it with anaoniis  valume 
 docker run -v "C:\Users\habdullayev\Documents\others\GitHub\My Projects\Data-Engineering_Bootcamp:/app"    -v /myapp_folder/volumns_f... 

The reason si  that if you install the pachges  that not exist in your locak mahcine  the docker cannot find it in vlaue  beacuse the docker does not overrite your host computer therefore you have to give another value that docker write the packes into  this volume
